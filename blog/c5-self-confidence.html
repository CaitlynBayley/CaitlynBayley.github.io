    <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
        <p>Self-awareness stems from a study of emotional awareness. By observing our emotions in different situations,
            we can startto understand the way they behave. From creating this space we can objectively observe our emotions,
             as we do our thoughts during mindfulness. We observe the emotion, we accept the emotion and we can let go of
             the emotion if we understand it doesn't define us or the situation we are in. To develop a strong emotional awareness,
             can lead to a more accurate self-assessment, which gives us the tools to increase our own self confidence.

    <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).
        What was your experience of it? Hot did you feel?
        I tried the Body Scan as the book suggested.  It was a interesting exercise where I identified parts of my body that where
        tense and holding a lot of stress.  I had little to no awareness of these parts of my body before starting the scan.  By reaching
        these points, I could release the muscle and place my body in a more relaxing position and then continue to move through to other
        areas.  After sitting in this position for several minutes and conciously drawing on positive emotions, my body felt lighter, as 
        though there was more space inside of me.

     <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed this last section! It is a thought I have had before and typically it leads me down a path
            where I end up having an existential crisis. But it is so true, we are not our emotions or our thoughts.
            My emotions drive and define a lot of my experiences on a day-to-day basis, and strong common emotions and ways
            of thinking are central to many of my friendships.  It is a good reminder that while they may be "true", they 
            come and go, constantly shifting.  To acknowledge them and their impact while knowing they will pass is a very
            liberating and terrifying thought...
