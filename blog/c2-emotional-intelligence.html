      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <h3>What learnings did you take from the Chapter?</h3>
      <p>Although I am quite familiar with certain elements of emotional intelligence, it was good to recap and learn more about
          how it is thought of in a more structured sense.  I definitely recognise and learning more about emotional intelligence in my early adult 
          years, through relationships, arts and the practice of meditation at times.  I think this chapter reminded me of the value and 
          importance of this and gave some very practical steps to starting the practice.

        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
            It was an interesting way to experience time.  It feels both like a long time and short time when you are in it.
            Sometimes my mind wandered off, but it became easier to realise this early and come back to my breath.
            It made me realise how long two minutes really is, and how well you could potentially use that time.
