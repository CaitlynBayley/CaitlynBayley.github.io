    <h3> What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? </h2>
    <p>It is a learning environment that requires you to be comfortable with your vulnerability, understand yourself, your limits, your capacity to learn and create.  By DBC/EDA providing tools and allowing space for these experiences to happen alongside content being taught by highly skilled teachers, it allows for rapid learning and personal growth.  </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>My impressions have been positive.  Based on my own experiences and styles of learning, I know it is important that I work alongside people with similar social values and I have been really enjoyed the conversations about EDA’s culture. From what I have seen and heard, I understand it is going to be challenging and rewarding. It is exciting and scary to know I will experience a spectrum of emotions to come away from EDA with a great set of skills and friendships. </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture</h2>  
    <p>I think initially I will be observing how other people are engaging until I become more familiar and participate more openly.  I have the tendancy to be quite shy before I’m ready to contribute.  I work well alongside other people in team environments and I think I will enjoy the experience of partnering with different people throughout the course.  </p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>Yes they have.  After I watching this video and visiting the EDA campus for the first time, I now know I will need to be more emotionally and physically commited to Phase 0, more so than what I had thought.  I don’t think I realised how much this will contribute to my own and the cohort’s learning experience.</p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>I am both excited and nervous to be in this learning environment!  It’s a strange feeling to be at the start, anticipating the intensity and workload.  I’m really excited to learn so much in a short amount of time, as well as experiencing it alongside other people, who I will no doubt become good friends with.  I’m excited to meet new people! I’m nervous already but I’m very pleased to be scared and to be taking a risk.</p>
