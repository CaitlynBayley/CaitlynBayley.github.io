  •	What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
It is a learning environment that requires you to be comfortable with your vulnerability, understand yourself, your limits, your capacity to learn and create.  By DBC/EDA providing tools and allowing space for these experiences to happen alongside content being taught by highly skilled teachers, it allows for rapid learning and personal growth.  
•	What are your impressions?
My impressions have been positive.  Based on my own experiences and styles of learning, I know it is important that I work alongside people with similar social values and I have been really enjoyed the conversations about EDA’s culture. From what I have seen and heard, I understand it is going to be challenging and rewarding. It is exciting and scary to know I will experience a spectrum of emotions to come away from EDA with a great set of skills and friendships.
•	How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture
I think initially I will be observing how other people are engaging until I become more familiar and participate more openly.  I have the tendancy to be quite shy before I’m ready to contribute.  I work well alongside other people in team environments and I think I will enjoy the experience of partnering with different people throughout the course.  
•	Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
Yes they have.  After I watching this video and visiting the EDA campus for the first time, I now know I will need to be more emotionally and physically commited to Phase 0, more so than what I had thought.  I don’t think I realised how much this will contribute to my own and the cohort’s learning experience.  
•	Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
I am both excited and nervous to be in this learning environment!  It’s a strange feeling to be at the start, anticipating the intensity and workload.  I’m really excited to learn so much in a short amount of time, as well as experiencing it alongside other people, who I will no doubt become good friends with.  I’m excited to meet new people! I’m nervous already but I’m very pleased to be scared and to be taking a risk.

•	Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
I went through them all and spent more time on the Timebox/Pomodoro Technique, as I knew less about these methods.  I have had more experience with mindfulness and meditation and am aware of the effects but it was still useful to understand the relationship between this and new methods I was reading.  

•	What did you find interesting?
I thought making time orientated commitments rather than allocating an indefinite amount of time to achieve a particular goal was interesting.  A lot of what I’m learning at the moment is new to me so I think measuring time rather than tasks will be more effective for me until I have more experience and a better understanding of how long activities can take me personally.

•	What worked for you?
Timbeox was great.  I set aside 1 hour and it literally took me 1 hour to work my way through them all without me paying a great deal of attention of my time and progress as I was working through.  I think this could be a very useful skill when it comes to me managing my workload.

•	Which will you experiment further with?
Timebox, starting small and the intense immersive experience I can have within these timeframes.
