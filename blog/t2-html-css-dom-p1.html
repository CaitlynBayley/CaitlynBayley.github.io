    <h2>A Garden of HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>

        <p>If we were to look at a garden and understand it as if it were a web page, we could see that HTML (HyperText Markup Language) would be used to create different frames and objects. The trees, plants and furniture could all be created with HTML and placed in certain parts of the garden.</p>
  
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) would then be used to colour the trees, plants and furniture.  You could choose to add a pink flower or a long wooden bench.  The patterned tree leaves could compliment the smaller bushes beneath; you could cast a moving shadow over a particular part of the lawn.</p>

        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) would be the landscaper's scaled drawing of the garden, the plan that shows all of the details.  This would allow someone to stand on the garden edge with the drawing held in front, specifying what each object was, where it was placed and how it physically appeared and interacted with what was around it.</p>

    <h2>Boxifying Design</h2>

        <p> By viewing the landscaper's scaled drawing, we can group the plants, trees and furniture that have been placed around the garden in to boxes.  The edge of the garden boarder would be the first box.  Within that, there are smaller boxes like garden beds, that group the individual objects together.</p>

    <h2>The Box Model</h2>

        <p>The Box Model looks like a box with many boxes inside of it.  It is used to structure and place content wrapped with padding, a border and margin.  It would be like planting a flower, adding mulch to the base to protect it from weeds, planting companion plants around it, as it sits within the garden bed that has been cut from the lawn.</p>
