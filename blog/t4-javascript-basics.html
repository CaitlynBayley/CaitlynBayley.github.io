    <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
        <p>HTML and CSS are both used to write up a webpage.  They are static in the sense they build and format the page
            as you see it.  When looking at how all three languages build the page, HTML is used to write what it is, 
            CSS is what it looks like and JavaScript defines what it does. JavaScript is an interactive script that 
            creates active commands for the page to allow you to programme a response or action.  For example, if someone
            clicks or hovers over a certain section of the page, JavaScript can be used to follow some more rules to interact 
            on the page.
        </p>
    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' </h3>
        <p> The browser will run one instruction or line of Javascript code at a time. Control Flow is the sequence in which
            these instructions are read and shown.  The Javascript code will operate in a consecutive order until the code
            instructs otherwise. Loops instruct the code to be repeatidly read and operate a certain command until it moves
            to the next instruction.
        </p>
        <p> We can use the example of brushing your teeth understand how control flow and loops work better. Here are a set of
            rules for someone to follow to clean their teeth.  The person will need to start with the first instruction, entering
            the bathroom, and work through each of these until they reach a stage where the flow of control will loop.  At this
            point the person will need to repeatidly brush each of their teeth until they are all clean. At which point they will
            carry on going through the instructions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter bathroom</li>
            <li>Pick up toothbrush</li>
            <li>Pick up toothpaste</li>
            <li>Squeeze toothpaste on to toothbrush</li>
            <li>Place the toothpaste back to where it belongs</li>
            <li>Brush teeth back and forth with toothbrush</li>
            <li>Repeat this over each tooth until all teeth are clean</li>
            <li>Spit toothpaste out</li>
            <li>Rinse mouth with water</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps until the water runs clear and no toothpaste remains</li>
            <li>Leave bathroom</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>Arrays and objects store information, or data used for instructing a command.  Arrays are listed so 
            to access the data from an Array, a person needs to instruct the browser to access it from what number it is,
            where it is placed within the list.  It is important to remember the first array is listed at zero, so to 
            access data from the 12th array, you need to requestion array[11].
        </p>
        <p>
            Data and information are stored inside objects with labels.  To access this information someone needs to know
            the label.
        </p>
    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p> A function is a statement that performs a task. The function is named and contains specific information
            for the task to happen.  Functions are useful as once they have been defined, they can be invoked, call or
            executed at any stage by simply writing the name of the function.  They create useful shortcuts for a particular
            action to be used!
