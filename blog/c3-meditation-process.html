  <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>

  <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading Chapter 2?</h3>
    <p>I understood it to be useful but it definitely provided more examples of this. I have learnt different meditation techniques
        in the past and it was good to read through these again.
    </p>
  <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
    <p>Firstly, I enjoyed learning about meta-attention, it is something I have experienced but never known how to describe. The physical,
        scientific effects were interesting to learn more about as well. Although the mental and emotional benefits may seem clear, the 
        physical results of a stronger immune system are quite incredible.
    </p>
  <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
    <p>One point that I would really like to build on is to experience without judging or reacting. The technique of taking five deep breaths
        before reacting seems very challenging but I think it could impact my life positively.
