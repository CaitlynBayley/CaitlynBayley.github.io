<h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>

<h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
    <p>The three techniques that can be used to sustain a mindful conversation are listening, looping and dipping.
        To listen in this case, is to give your full attention to the person speaking.  Looping is when someone has finished
        speaking and the other person provides feedback on what they heard them say.  The person that spoke then has a chance
        to clarify if their interpretation is correct and this can go back and forth until both people have the right message.
        I would like to practice dipping in my own meditation practice. This happens as we have given someone our full attention
        to listen, and we are able to check in and acknowledge internal distractions while doing so.  By dipping we can improve 
        our ability to listen and gently let go of any positive or negative thoughts/feelings that arise.
