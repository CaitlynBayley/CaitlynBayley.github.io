  <h3>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</h3>
    <p>A responsive site is one website that has been designed to function on any sized screen.  There is 
        just one set of code, but it may look a little bit different on different sized screens depending on how
        the user navigates the site and accesses the information.  Responsiveness is important because it
        allows for lots of people to access the same information in different ways. It allows the content
        to be presented in a way that uses the space (screen size) most effiently, so the user can get what they 
        need and go where they want to go effieciently.

    <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h3>
    <p>Mobile first design is a responsive design strategy where the site is built for the mobile device users first
        as it is considered the most challenging.  It is important as a user accessing the site from a mobile device
        has a much smaller screen and needs to be presented with large readable information that is easy to navigate. 
        Considering the size restrictions, the information needs to be prioritised so that it is still accessible.

    <h3>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons?</h3>
    <p>A frameworks are basic structures or skeletons that can be used for you to organise your information or code. 
        Pros include it being a faster way to build a website and it is standardised so there are less mistakes (less time 
        and resources wasted).  Unfortunately if you want to alter the framework and make changes it is harder to do so.

    <h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>
    <p>A wireframe is a sketch of your website before any design elements have been added.  It is a basic boxified design
        which allows lets you map out the most important elements of the websites.  It ensures the users get the information they
        need from the site before looking at how that information has been customised.
