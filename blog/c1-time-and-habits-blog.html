    <h2>1. Time and Habits</h2>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>I went through them all and spent more time on the Timebox/Pomodoro Technique, as I knew less about these methods.  I have had more experience with mindfulness and meditation and am aware of the effects but it was still useful to understand the relationship between this and new methods I was reading.  </p>

    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
        
        <p>I thought making time orientated commitments rather than allocating an indefinite amount of time to achieve a particular goal was interesting.  A lot of what Iâ€™m learning at the moment is new to me so I think measuring time rather than tasks will be more effective for me until I have more experience and a better understanding of how long activities can take me personally.</p>

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
        <p>Timbeox was great.  I set aside 1 hour and it literally took me 1 hour to work my way through them all without me paying a great deal of attention of my time and progress as I was working through.  I think this could be a very useful skill when it comes to me managing my workload.</p>    

    <h3>What will you experiment further with?</h3> 
        <p>Timebox, starting small and the intense immersive experience I can have within these timeframes.</p>
